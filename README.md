# Java Exception Playground 

A modular Java console application designed to demonstrate robust exception handling in real-world scenarios. This project is ideal for learners and developers who want to understand how to write clean, maintainable, and safe Java code using `try-catch`, custom exceptions, input validation, and file I/O.

## ðŸ“š Features

- **Division Calculator**: Handles division-by-zero with clear error reporting.
- **File Reader Checker**: Reads text files with graceful failure on missing or unreadable files.
- **Input Validator**: Validates integer input within range and checks for empty input.
- **Expense Limit Checker**: Uses a custom checked exception to flag when expenses exceed a set limit.
- **Central CLI Menu**: Simple, interactive menu system for easy testing and exploration.
